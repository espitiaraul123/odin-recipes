        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>You don't have to run to the mall to satisfy your craving for cinnamon rolls — soft and warm from the oven and drizzled with icing. We'll show you step by step how to make cinnamon rolls from scratch — from making the dough to filling, forming, baking, and icing — with loads of helpful tips along the way.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>dough</li>
            <li>cinnamon</li>
            <li>icing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select dough cycle; press Start.</li>
            <li>After the dough has doubled in size turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Roll dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.</li>
